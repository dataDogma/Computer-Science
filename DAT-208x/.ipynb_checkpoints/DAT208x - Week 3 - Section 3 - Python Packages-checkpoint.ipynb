    "## Installing Python Packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all packages come packaged with python distribution, some of them have to be downloaded and installed manually. To do this following step should be followed:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ First, identify what package to use, this would be \"package name\", for instance (say) `Numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Second, install `pip`, a python package management system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Third, use the follwoing template to install desired packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `pip_version_number install < package name >`\n",
    "    \n",
    "     for example, `pip3 install numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Lastly, before you use the installed packages, you have to explicitly tell python about it, this is done by _importing the package._\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be done in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. To import all the contents of a package: `import < package name >`\n",
    "2. To import a specific method or module from the package: \n",
    "\n",
    "> `from < package name > import < function, method name or type name >`\n",
    "\n",
    "-- --\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to use a package, simply use this template:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`< package name > . < func, method or type name > ( object )`\n",
    "\n",
    "This could be cumbersome sometimes, hence we can shorten the former statement by using an 'alias'. Using the templet mentioned below:\n",
    "\n",
    ">`import < package name > as < desired alias >`\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. `import numpy as np` ( here `np` is an 'alias' ) then using the package like this,\n",
    "\n",
    ">`< alias name > . < func, method or type name >`\n",
